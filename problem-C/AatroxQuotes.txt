They think me defeated, enchained. But I am unbowed... Noble is this carnage.
Am I the abyss? Or did I gaze into it?
This cursed form... This crude decaying flesh! I loathe it!
Patience, Aatrox! Patience! Your freedom will come!
March toward vengeance... Drown this world in blood!
They will call me villain... Come, let me earn their hatred, again and forever.
I am Aatrox, I am the World-Ender!
Carnage, hate, yes! I am the World-Ender!
Death to all! The World-Ender awaits!
Tricked into this existence... False slave entrapped by endless life! I shall become a beast feeding on their destruction, and making them lament my unholy birth!
Cleave through them, Aatrox! Crush their skulls! Shatter their ribs! Disembowl their very souls!" *Heavy breathing* "Our vengeance is at hand!
The heavens, the endless skies folding into each other. Where are they now?
How far I have fallen! A god... reduced to a prisoner!
March flesh, march toward them! We have horrors to sow! Lives to reap! Let me make them regret... being free.
I am but an unholy copy of life... A mockery of its freedom... And born in the cruel betrayal of the noble ideals I would've served
I touched the stars, and saw the glorious light of a thousand suns! Now, blinded by this elegance, how could my purpose be anything... but dark...
To war, Aatrox! They shall not rob us of our nobility! We shall stand, and spit venom at our tormentors for eternity!
